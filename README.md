# Jarvis Voice Assistant

A smart voice assistant application built using Python. Jarvis can perform various tasks such as fetching weather updates, providing news headlines, and responding to user commands through speech. This project leverages speech recognition, text-to-speech, and external APIs to provide a seamless user experience.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Converts spoken commands into text using speech recognition.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts responses into spoken audio.
- **Weather Updates**: Fetches and reports current weather information.
- **News Headlines**: Retrieves and displays recent news headlines.

## Installation

To get started with Jarvis Voice Assistant, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jarvis_voice_assistant.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd jarvis_voice_assistant
   ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## API Keys

This project uses external APIs for weather and news information. To use these features, you need to provide your own API keys. Replace the placeholders in `src/weather_api.py` and `src/news_api.py` with your API keys:

```python
# src/weather_api.py
api_keys = {
    'weather': 'YOUR_WEATHER_API_KEY',
}
```

```python
# src/news_api.py
api_keys = {
    'news': 'YOUR_NEWS_API_KEY',
}
```

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

2. **Speak Commands**

   Jarvis will listen for your voice commands and respond accordingly. Commands can include requests for weather updates, news headlines, and more.
